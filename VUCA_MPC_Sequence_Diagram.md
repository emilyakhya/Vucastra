## Framework Components Description

### 1. **Middle Power Country (MP)**
- Initiates the analysis process
- Provides country-specific data
- Receives strategic recommendations
- Implements feedback loops

### 2. **VUCA Analysis Engine**
- **Volatility**: Measures rate of change in geopolitical environment
- **Uncertainty**: Assesses predictability of future events
- **Complexity**: Evaluates interconnectedness of factors
- **Ambiguity**: Analyzes clarity of cause-effect relationships

### 3. **MPC Assessment Engine**
- **Economic Capabilities**: GDP, trade relations, financial stability
- **Political Capabilities**: Governance quality, policy effectiveness
- **Security Capabilities**: Military strength, alliance networks
- **Diplomatic Capabilities**: International influence, negotiation skills

### 4. **Machine Learning Engine**
- Integrates VUCA and MPC data
- Applies predictive algorithms
- Generates diplomatic success probabilities
- Continuously learns from outcomes

### 5. **Optimization Engine**
- Allocates resources optimally
- Assesses risks and opportunities
- Generates strategic recommendations
- Adapts to changing conditions

### 6. **Data Sources**
- Geopolitical databases (Correlates of War, Polity IV)
- Economic indicators (World Bank, IMF, OECD)
- Security data (SIPRI, Global Firepower Index)
- Diplomatic records (UN Treaties, bilateral agreements)

### 7. **Strategic Outputs**
- Policy recommendations
- Risk assessment reports
- Resource allocation plans
- Early warning alerts
